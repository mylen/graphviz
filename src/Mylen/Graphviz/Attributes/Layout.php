 *   layout. In some cases, however, it can be convenient to embed the type
 *   of layout desired within the graph. For example, a graph containing
 *   position information from a layout might want to record what the
 *   associated layout algorithm was.

 *   the <A HREF=command-line-invocation#minusK>-K flag</a>
